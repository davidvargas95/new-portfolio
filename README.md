## Description

This webpage is a simple landing page to display what I have made thus far. It is meant to demonstrate the skills I have acquired and the languages and technologies that I have learned to use.

The page takes advantage of primarily HTML and CSS. Bootstrap layouts were used to build out many of the components on the page with custom CSS overlayed on some features.

## Usage

Use this webpage to view the applications that I have completed. Multiple ways to contact me are listed in the footer. Use and enjoy what I have created!
